# nainas-dream
an amalgamation of what I'm trying to do. I'm going through a bit of a rut, but I feel as though I've been perpetually in a rut since the inception of my existence. I have unfortunately not been very present in my own life, and I now lack hobbies, a personality, and just a general sense of self. Gosh this is so emo, I'm making this creative website to encourage myself to not be overwhelmed by the things I want to do, but to be excited for them, despite the limited time in a day. Though I tend to be a bit slow at things now, I know this won't always be the case. I know that I'm capable. I've proved to myself that I have the discipline, now comes the action.
